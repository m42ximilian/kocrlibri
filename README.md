## Researching OCR and LLM functionality for web browser automation

### Core functionality:
* Read screen into buffer
* Perform OCR on it
* Perform browsing automation
* Leverage LLM to make sense of OCR output

### Benchmarks:
* Scraping LinkedIn
* Scraping Blinkist
* Scraping Amazon

### TODO: 
* Fix segemantation-fault (likely caused by GUI implementation)
* Integrate system tray
* Set up GUI
* Integrate realisitic mouse movements and keyboard stroke - as in simulating user browsing behavior
* Integrate better chatbot to give instructions to script
  

### Ideas:
* Integrating Selenium for background browser automations on pages which allow for it
* Integrate webUI classification to optimise for scraping and browsing targets
